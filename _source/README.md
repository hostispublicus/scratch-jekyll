# UI Static Templates Jekyll Scratch Project

The compiled HTML/CSS/JS is in ../_site folder.
To add site-specific CSS/JS use css/foo-custom.css and js/foo-custom.js files.

CSS editing is done only via modifying SCSS files.
SASS based Compass framework is being used - http://compass-style.org/

The HTML part is combined with jekyll - http://jekyllrb.com/, install it before editing anything.

After you had Compass and Jekyll installed - run compass-watch.bat and jekyll-watch.bat to compile.
